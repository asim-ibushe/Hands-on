Def:
Data structure is the way of storing & manipulating the data in a particular format.
#The concept of data structure can be implemented in any programming language because it is language independent.
#Types of data structures:
There are two types of data structures as linear & non-linear.
-If the data gets accessed in the linear way then it is considered as linear data structure.
e.g: linked list,stack,queue
-Non linear data structures:
If the data gets accessed in a non linear format then it is considered as non-linear data structure.
e.g: Tree, Graph
