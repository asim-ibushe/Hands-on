//Binary Search Tree(bst)

Tree is the non-linear data structure where we access the elements of the tree in non-linear fashion.
Binary tree is a type of tree where each node has atmost two child nodes.
BST is a type of tree which is used for the searching purpose.

##Practical implementation of binary search tree

struct node
{
int data;
struct node* Lchild;
struct node* Rchild;
}
