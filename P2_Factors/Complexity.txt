Complexity of an Algorithm-
	There are two types of complexity as
1.Time complexity
2.Space complexity
These two are considered as an important factor for the commercial programming.
Time complexity-	If our application contains the iteration(loops) then we can calculate the time complexity.
As a programmer our target is to reduce the time complexity
If input of our function is five thousand and if our function contains a loop which iterates for 5000 times then the time complexity of that function is O(N)
If we accept 5000 as an input and our loop iterates for 2500 times then the time complexity is O(N/2)

Space complexity-	space complexity of a program is purely depends on the dynamic memory allocation used in our program.
By using dynamic memory allocation ,we try to reduce space complexity of our program.
