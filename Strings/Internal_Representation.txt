Consider the below program which contains character & integer.
we have to consider the internal representation of that character & integer.
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
char ch='A';//65 ascii value

//128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
// 0   1  0  0 0 0 0 1 //Actual character binary
int no=10;
//
//0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 //binary representation of Decimal 10

return 0;
}

According to above diagram we conclude that character gets one byte of memory & when we consider its internal representation it's ascii value gets consider.
At the time of storing that character into the memory its binary value of ascii gets considered.
The concept of ascii value is not applicable for the other data types like integer float & double.
while solving the problem statements based on the character & strings there is no need to consider its ascii value.
Instead of using that ascii value we can use that specific character in single quotes
