//Recursion-
If we want to perform one instruction multiple times then, we use the concept of iteration.
Instead of iteration we can use the concept of recursion.
Recursion means calling the function from the same function itself.
Recursion is considered as an heavy approach because it requires stack manipulation.
Every problem that we can solve using iteration can be solved using recursion.

#contents of stack frame
1.memory for local variable
2.memory for input arguments
3.address of next instruction to be exe
4.value of old EBP (base pointer)
stack holds ESP(stack pointer)
E-stands for Extended
