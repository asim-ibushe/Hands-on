//Problems on Bitwise Operators
/*
1.In this topic we deal with the bits of the given number.
2.In this topic we have to use the bitwise operators to solve any of the problem statements
3.The concept of bitwise operators is exactly same in any programming language c, cpp, java, python.
All the above mentioned programming languages uses same set of bitwise operators.
Expression EG:-
(no1	Operand1
 +	Operator 
no2)	Operand2
Expression is considered as a statement which contains set of operator and operands.
operators are considered as a symbol which decides the operation that we need to perform.
Depends on the behaviour of the operator .Types of operator As=
Arithmetic Operator(+-*/%)
Logical Operator(&& ||)
Assignment Operator(==)
Comparision Operator(<>)
ShortHand Operator
Bitwise Operator(AND OR XOR NOT LEFTSHIFT RIGHTSHIFT)
***bitwise operator are classified as
  Operands Req
& binary
| binary
^ binary
~ unary
<< binary
>> binary

Bit1	Bit2	&	|	^
0	0	0	0	0
0	1	0	1	1
1	0	0	1	1
1	1	1	1	0

Bit	~
1	0
0	1

#conversion of decimal to binary 
POWER OF 2  (8 7 6  5  4 3 2 1 0)
	    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
0	86		
1	43
1	21
0	10
1	5
0	2
	1->int no=86;
Memory Layout=(00000000 00000000 00000000 0   1  0  1  0 1 1 0)Binary
					  128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
CONSIDER THE ABOVE CONVERSION FROM BINARY TO DECIMAL=64+16+4+2=86

PROBLEM 2:
NUM=121       
1	121
0	60
0	30
1	15
1	7
1	3
1	1
	0
		128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
		(0  1  1  1  1 0 0 1)=64+32+16+8+1=121
