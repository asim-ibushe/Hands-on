//Space complexity
/*
space complexity is depends on the dynamic memory allocation performed by the application.
if our application deals with N and inside the application if we allocate the memory for n elements then the space complexity of that application is O(N).
space complexity is not related with the no of bytes that we allocate but it is related with the no of elements that we want to allocate.
#steps to solve the n numbers application
START
inside main...
1.Accept the count of array numbers from user
2.allocate the memory for that N numbers (Dynamically)
3.accept the values in that allocated memory
4.Helper Function: pass the address and the size to the function
5.Actual Logic of Program: function will perform the operation on array without any alteration
6.after return to the main function deallocate array memory
leave main... 
STOP

In any question all the above steps are exactly same, Just we have to add the logic inside step5.
